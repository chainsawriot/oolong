## Resubmission (31-May-2021) - version 0.4.0

    Not more than 5 MB for a CRAN package, please.

I have reduced the size of the package to 3.5MB. I hope it is now acceptable.

    The CRAN comments are way too long to read, hence I may have missed an explanation for the size? Please only give relevant information for the current submission.
	
I have also removed previous entries in CRAN comments.
