The goal of oolong (烏龍, literally means "Dark Dragon", is a semi-oxidized tea from Asia. It is very popular in Taiwan, Japan and Hong Kong) is to generate and adminstrate validation tests easily for typical automated content analysis tools such as topic models and dictionary-based tools.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("chainsawriot/oolong")
```

## Example

`newsgroup_stm` is an example topic model trained with the data `newsgroup5` using the `stm` package. Currently, this package supports structural topic models / correlated topic models from `stm` and Wrap LDA models from `text2vec`.

```{r example}
library(oolong)
library(stm)
newsgroup_stm
```

To create an oolong test, use the function `create_oolong_test`.

```{r createtest}
oolong_test <- create_oolong(newsgroup_stm)
oolong_test
```

As instructed, use the method `$do_word_intrusion_test()` to start coding. If you are running this in RStudio, you should see a test screen similar to this:

<img src="man/figures/oolong_demo.gif" align="center" />

After the coding, you can look at the accuracy rate by printing the oolong test.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
oolong_test
```
